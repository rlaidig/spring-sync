> July 28, 2025: This application comes from a Spring attic, and is no longer in development.
> The entire spring-sync library was not updated for vulnerabilities, rather only what was needed with vulnerabilities remediation.
> The entire spring-sync library was forked, but removed from building if vulnerabilites were not addressed.
